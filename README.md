DUnit
=====

**Advanced unit testing toolkit.**

---

DUnit is a unit testing toolkit for the D programming language. The toolkit comprises of a solution to mocking objects and a library to enable more expressive and helpful assertions.

Unit testing is necessary to assert *units* of code perform in isolation and conform to repeatable and known expectations. DUnit gives you the tools to make this task an easier one.

Supported platforms
-------------------
DUnit was developed and tested with DMD v2.063.2 and should support any platform DMD supports as it only contains platform independent code. Other compilers have not been tested but should build fine.

Documentation
-------------
There is full HTML documentation in the `docs/` directory.

Example
-------
	import dunit.mockable;
	import std.algorithm;
	import std.stdio;

	/**
	 * Simple class representing a person.
	 */
	class Person
	{
		private string _name;
		private int _age;

		this()
		{
		}

		this(string name, int age)
		{
			this._name = name;
			this._age  = age;
		}

		public string getName()
		{
			return this._name;
		}

		public int getAge()
		{
			return this._age;
		}
		
		// Mixin mocking behaviour.
		mixin Mockable!(Person);
	}

	/**
	 * Processor class that uses Person as a dependency.
	 */
	class Processor
	{
		private Person[] _people;

		public void addPerson(Person person)
		{
			this._people ~= person;
		}

		public ulong getAmountOfPeople()
		{
			return this._people.length;
		}

		public float getMeanAge()
		{
			return cast(float)reduce!((a, b) => a + b.getAge())(0, this._people) / this.getAmountOfPeople();
		}
	}

	unittest
	{
		import dunit.toolkit;

		// Create mock people.
		auto gary  = Person.getMock();
		auto tessa = Person.getMock();

		// Mock the getAge method to return 40. Set the minimum count to 1 and the maximum count to 1.
		gary.mockMethod("getAge", delegate(){
			return 40;
		}, 1, 1);

		// Mock the getAge method to return 34. Set the minimum count to 1 and the maximum count to 1.
		tessa.mockMethod("getAge", delegate(){
			return 34;
		}, 1, 1);

		// Create the object we are unit testing.
		auto processor = new Processor();

		// Add mock people to the processor.
		processor.addPerson(gary);
		processor.addPerson(tessa);

		// Make assertions of the processor, calling the mock methods on the mock class.
		processor.getAmountOfPeople().assertEqual(2);
		processor.getMeanAge().assertEqual(37);

		// Assert mock method calls are within limits.
		gary.assertMethodCalls();
		tessa.assertMethodCalls();
	}
